Bloom Filter

Implemented a bloom filter using usernames known to spam in a time frame of 30 days and tested it against usernames collected in a time frame of 365 days 

Used http://www.stopforumspam.com/downloads/listed_username_30.zip as the set to build the filter and used http://www.stopforumspam.com/downloads/listed_username_365.zip as the stream.
